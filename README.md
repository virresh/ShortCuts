# ShortCuts  

This is the repository for ShortCuts, a to-be android application that aims to create a summary of your precious videos using Machine Learning algorithms (can optionally act as a video editor, though it depends on how much time I get to implement the desired features).  

### Motivation  
Very often we want to capture our precious moments as videos, but they get quite lengthy. Usually we don't have time to go through each of those videos to relive the moments. Also sharing such huge videos with others over social media platforms takes a lot of space on phone and people often don't watch such long videos. This app provides a solution. With the help of modern Machine Learning algorithms, it will create small video summaries (let's call them `Cuts`). With these Short Cuts, you can easily share your long moments and relive them quickly. (And yeah, that's why I call it ShortCuts).  

### Technical One Line Description  
It's an extractive video summarizer on phone.

### Way ahead for this project  
I'd like to propose this project for the 2019 Android Development Challenge. The challenge will give me sufficient resources and guidance to build this project quickly if this project get's selected. However I acknowledge that the space is competitive and thus in case it doesn't make it into the program, I'll try developing it at leisure as a side Open Source Project.  

Approximate Timeline:
  - December 25th 2019: Research on the available video summarisation techniques for edge devices. Brainstorm the flow and UI.
  - January 10th 2020: First Prototype of the video summarisation app. Start working on UI and UX improvements.
  - January 30th 2020: Start unit-testing and instrumentation testing. Complete all compatibility checks and make application more robust.
  - February 29th 2020: Completed UI enhancements and additional features that come up during research. Prepare app for deployment.
  - May 1st 2020: Application launched on Google Play Store!
